					<h1>What is Trigon?</h1>
					<p>Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 at the University of Virginia. Originally a political society, Trigon is now a much more socially-oriented brotherhood which also participates in service projects for both the University and the Charlottesville community. Trigon holds an annual rush and enjoys social activities such as parties, biannual and summer retreats, a semi-formal each spring, beach week at Myrtle Beach and attending the Spring Foxfield races. <a href="/history">Read More…</a></p>
